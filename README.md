# Nussinov-Algorithm

Project for UIUC CS466 Introduction to Bioinformatics

This repo provides the Python implementation to:
1. the Nussinov algorithm to fill the DP table to find the maximum number of pseudoknot-free complementary base pairs.
2. reconstruct the secondary structure by tracing back from the constructed table.

## Motivations
For a RNA sequence, the Nussinov algorithm can find the pseudoknot-free secondary structure with maximum number of complementary base  pairings in O(n^3) time, where n is the length of the input RNA sequence.
